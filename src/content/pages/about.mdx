## Hello and Welcome!

I am Tugrul Ates – a technologist, an artist, an explorer, and an enthusiast of the wonders that lie in between. Maybe we know each other already, or perhaps you are here to learn more about me. Either way, I am glad you are here.

## My story

My life is fueled by a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of technology – a power that, when harnessed, has the potential to significantly enhance human lives. I am delighted to dedicate my life to being a part of this transformation.

A fundamental pillar of the human experience is creating **art**, a mirror reflecting the models of our surroundings and emotions. Art and technology propose a fascinating fusion for me. I find joy in their convergence, ever since I put my crayons away and started drawing pixels on my CRT television in the late 1980s.

Our need for **connection**, to multiply our joy and divide our grief with other people, is another core tenet of humanity. Technology has always redefined the boundaries of connection. However, it was during the 1990s, growing up in the _banlieues_ of Ankara, I have witnessed like-minded people from around the world visiting my home, first at 28.8 kb/s, later at the speed of light. This is not just inspiring to me, I want all the remaining barriers eliminated for humans to find solace in each other.

The equation for **productivity** has changed forever in the 2000s, and I was a witness to the event. Driven by a desire to awe others with technology, I played with neural networks as they were about to make a comeback, scraped Wikipedia to build natural language models, and built algorithms to watch and judge our movements through cameras.

Finally, I have a firm belief that **prosperity** can be generated through technology, on a scale previously unimaginable. It democratizes opportunities, breaks down barriers to entry, and broadens the participation in economic activity. Through my work, I have had the privilege of contributing to the technological leap of the 2010s, bringing the web, e-commerce, and global entertainment to billions of smartphones and their humans.

The current decade, and its meaning for humanity, makes me excited. I am committing to be a part of our shared story by building companies and technologies that advance the core needs of all humans. I cannot wait to connect and exchange ideas with other technologists, anywhere, and on this very website.
