I published professionally and as a student. My research was about computer vision, computer graphics, video processing and content understanding. I want my publications to be available to everyone. You can find them here.

More information about these publications can be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tugrul-Ates) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZdYOsOwAAAAJ).
