Hello! I am Tugrul Ates â€“ an enthusiast for technology, arts, and everything in between. This is my website where I publish what I want to share with the world.

My first taste of programming was in 1994 on a Commodore 64, and I have been manipulating bytes and pixels ever since. I still have the same excitement and fun that I had back then.

I worked at Google at Meta between 2011 and 2021, as a software engineer and a manager. Among a breadth of other things, I am proud of the improvements I made to the Google Play and Facebook apps. Today, I am the founder of Roka Software, which aims to increase digital productivity for everyone. I aim to write about these experiences in this space.

Digital art, animations, and photography give me joy. In person, you will find me giving long tirades about the spreadsheets I create. I also like snowboarding, scuba diving, yoga, board games, and cats.

I get along with like-minded people, even if they are dog people, so you should feel free to reach out!
