Hello! I'm Tugrul Ates, an enthusiast of technology, arts, and everything that falls in between. This website is my digital canvas, where I share my thoughts, creations, and experiences with the world.

My journey in the realm of programming began in 1994 on a Commodore 64, and I've manipulating bytes and pixels ever since. The thrill and enjoyment I discovered in those early days continues to this day.

Between 2011 and 2021, I worked at Google and Meta, contributing as both a software engineer and a manager. I take pride in the significant improvements I brought to the Google Play and Facebook apps. Today, I channel my energy into **Roka Software**, a company I founded to enhance digital productivity for all.

In the realm of creativity, digital art, animations, and photography are my sanctuaries of joy. In casual conversations, you may find me enthusiastically discussing the intricate spreadsheets I craft. My other pursuits include scuba diving, yoga, and spending time with my cats.

I enjoy connecting with people who share similar interests, even if they are dog enthusiasts. So, if you find a resonance with any part of my world, don't hesitate to reach out!
