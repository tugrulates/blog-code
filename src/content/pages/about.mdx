Hello! I am Tugrul Ates and I love technology, art, and everything in between. This website is my digital canvas, where I share my thoughts, creations, and experiences with the world.

My journey in the realm of programming began in 1994 on a Commodore 64, and I've manipulating bytes and pixels ever since. The thrill and enjoyment I discovered in those early days continues to this day.

Between 2011 and 2021, I worked at Google and Meta, contributing as both a software engineer and a manager. I take pride in the significant improvements I brought to the Google Play and Facebook apps. Today, I channel my energy into [**Roka Software**](https://roka.software), a company dedicated to enhancing digital productivity for all.

Digital art, animations, and photography are my sanctuaries of joy. In casual conversations, you may find me enthusiastically discussing the intricate spreadsheets I craft. My other pursuits include scuba diving, yoga, and my cats.

I enjoy connecting with people who share similar interests, even if they are dog people. So, if you find a resonance with any part of my world, don't hesitate to reach out!
